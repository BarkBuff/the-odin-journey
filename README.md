# ⚡ THE ODIN PROJECT: INITIATION PROTOCOL ⚡

> **WARNING:**
> You were *not* supposed to find this.

## What *is* The Odin Project?

They'll tell you it's a free open-source coding curriculum.
They'll say it's just HTML, CSS, JavaScript...
They’ll casually mention “full-stack” and “project-based learning.”

But that’s not the whole truth.
Not even close.

---

## The Truth They Don’t Want You To Know

Once you **start**, things change.

Your sleep patterns.
Your search history.
Your *very perception of divs and margins.*

You’ll begin to see layouts in your dreams.
You'll scream "WHY ISN’T IT CENTERED?!" into the void.
And the void... will respond with Flexbox.

## The Path Begins Here

Simple? That’s what *they* want you to believe.
But this is not just code. This is a **summoning**.

---

## Modules of the Mind

1. **Foundations** – Where your reality fractures and you learn that “console.log” is not just a function... it’s a *gateway*.
2. **Full Stack JavaScript** – You’ll build things. Real things. But at what cost?
3. **Projects** – Each one a trial. A test. A puzzle. A trap.

You will not emerge the same.

## Side Effects

* Sudden desire to reformat family websites.
* Whispering `git commit -m "final final FINAL version"` in your sleep.
* Mild CSS-induced hallucinations.
* Trust issues with semicolons.

---

## Before You Proceed

Ask yourself:

* Do you **yearn** for mastery?
* Can you **withstand** the debugging despair?
* Are you prepared to become the **dev you were destined to be**?

If yes… then **click** [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

But know this:

## Final Note

We were never here.
You never read this.
This README will self-destruct after your next `npm install`.

Good luck, Recruit. Odin is watching.
